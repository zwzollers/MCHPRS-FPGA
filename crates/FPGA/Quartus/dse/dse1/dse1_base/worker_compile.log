Warning: LOCKED port on the PLL is not properly connected on instance "fclk:fclk|fclk_0002:fclk_inst|altera_pll:altera_pll_i|general[0].gpll". The LOCKED port on the PLL should be connected when the FBOUTCLK port is connected. Although it is unnecessary to connect the LOCKED signal, any logic driven off of an output clock of the PLL will not know when the PLL is locked and ready.
